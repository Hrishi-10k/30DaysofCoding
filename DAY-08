P08:
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
Notice that you may not slant the container.

CODE:-
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int i = 0, j = height.size() - 1;
        int max_area = 0;
        while (i < j) {
            int current_area = min(height[i], height[j]) * (j - i);
            max_area = max(max_area, current_area);
            if (height[i] < height[j]) {
                i++;
            } else {
                j--;
            }
        }
        return max_area;
    }
};
